# Flaws in the system

## Vulenarability

A weakness htat can be exploited by a threat

## Exploit

A way of taking advantage of a vulnerability

## Vulnerability management

The process of finding and patching vulnerabilities

1. Identify vulnerabilities

2. Consider potential exploits

3. Prepare defenses against threats

4. Evaluate those defenses

## Zero-day

An exploit that was previously unknown

## Defense in depth

A layered approach to vulnerability management that reduces risk

## Defense in depth strategy

1. Perimeter layer

2. Network layer

3. Endpoint layer

4. Application layer

5. Data layer

## Exposure

A mistake that can be exploited by a threat

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list (CVE list)

An openly accessible dictionary of know vulnerabilities and exposures

## MITRE

A collection of non-profit research and development centers.

## CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)

An organization that volunteers to analyze and distribute information on eligible CVEs

## CVE List criteria

1. Independent of other issues

2. Recognized as a potentital security risk

3. Submitted with supporting evidence

# Identify system vulnerabilities

## Vulnerability assessment

The internal review process of an organization's security systems

## Vulnerability assessment process

1. Identification

2. Vulnerability analysis

3. Risk asessment

4. Remediationcou

# Cyber attack mindset

## Attack surface

All the potential vulnerabilities that as thrat actor could exploit

## Security Hardening

The process of strenghtening a system to reduce its vulnerabilities and attack surface

## Access points

- Direct access

- Removable media

- Social media platforms

- Email

- Wireless networks

- Cloud services

- Supply chains

## Attack vectors

The pathways attackers use to penetrate security defenses

## Practicing an attacker mindset

1. Identify a target

2. Determine how the target can ce accessed

3. Evaluate attack vectors that can be exploited

4. Find th etools and methods of attack

## Defending attack vectors

1. Educating users about security

2. Applying the principle of least privilege

3. Using the right security controls and tools

4. Building a diverse security team
