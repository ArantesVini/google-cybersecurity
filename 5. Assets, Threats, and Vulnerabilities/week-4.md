# Social engineering

## Threat

## Social engineering

A manipulation technique that exploit human error to gain private information, acess, or valuables.

## Stages of social engineering

1. Prepare
2. Establish trust
3. Use persuasion tactics
4. Disconnect from the target

## Preventing social engineering

- Implementing managerial controls
- Staying informed of trends

## Phising

## Phising kit

A collection of software tools needed to launch a phising campaign

## Phising kit tools

- Malicious attachments
- FFake data-collection forms
- Fraudulent web links

## Smishing

The use of text messages to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source

## Vishing

# Threat modeling

The process of identifying assets, their vulnerabilities, and how each is exopsed to threats

## Threat modeling steps

1. Define the scope
   (The inventory of assets)

2. Identify threats
   ( Define all potential threat actors)

3. Characterize the environment
   (Apply the attack mindset to the business)

4. Analyze threats
   (Examine existing protections and identify gaps)

5. Mitigate Risks
   (Creation of the defending against threats plans.)

6. Evaluate findings
   (Documentation of the process)

## PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)

A popular threat modeling framework that's used across many industries
