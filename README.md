My personal notes from Google Cybersecurity Course, available on Coursera

## About this course

This is a course offered by google in order to take a person to the beginner level and build a professional on cybersecurity, with mroe than 170 hours of instruction, hundres of reading material, hands-on pratices and tests. Also is a course that can be used a preparation to the certification **CompTIA Security+**

Organizations must continuously protect themselves and the people they serve from cyber-related threats, like fraud and phishing. They rely on cybersecurity to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their internal systems and information. Cybersecurity analysts use a collection of methods and technologies to safeguard against threats and unauthorized access â€” and to create and implement solutions should a threat get through.

The course is divided in 8 small courses:
- Foundations of Cybersecurity;
- Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks;
- Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security;
- Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL;
- Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities;
- Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response;
- Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python; and
- Put It to Work: Prepare for Cybersecurity Jobs.

Each course is divided by weeks and days, for each course I create a folder, and for each week a separated markdown file, in each markkdown file I divided into the main topic of the day and the subtopics, such as definitions of concepts.
