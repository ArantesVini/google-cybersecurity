## Communication and Network Security

Focused on managing and securingp hysical networks and wireless communications.

## Identity and Access Managment

Focused on access and authorization to keep data secure, by making sure users follow established policies to control and manage assets.

## Security Assessment and Testing

# Navigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities

## Threat

Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.

## Social engineering

A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

## Risk

**Anything** that can impact the condifentiality, itengrity, or availiability (CIA) of an asset.
They are divided in three groups, based on the risk of the asset:

### Low-risk asset

Information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised.

### Medium-risk asset

Informaiton that's not avaliable to the public and may cause some damage ot the organizaiton's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations.

### High-risk asset

Information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised would have a severe negtive impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation. Such as **PII**, **SPII** or **Intelectual property**.

## Vulnerability

A weakness that can be exploited by a threat. This can be a old-version software, non-protected data, weak passwords, and also, people.

## Ransomware

A malicious attack where threat actores encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.

## Layers of the web

- Surface web;
- Deep web;
- Dark web.

## Key impacts

## NIST's Risk Managment Framework (**RMF**)

There are seven steps in tjhe RMF:

- Prepare;
- Categorize;
- Select;
- Implement;
- Assess;
- Authorize;
- Monitor

### RMF Step 1 : Prepare

Activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs.

### RMF Step 2 : Categorize

Used to develop risk managment processes and tasks.

### RMF Step 3 : Select

Choose, customize, and caputre documentation of the controls that protect an organization

### RMF Step 4 : Implement

Implement security and privacy plans for the organization.

### RMF Step 5 : Assess

Determine if established controls are implemented correctly

### RMF Step 6 : Authorize

Being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization.

### RMF Step 7 : Monitor

Be aware of how systems are operating.

### RMF Step 8 :
