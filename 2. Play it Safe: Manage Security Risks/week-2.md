# More about frameworks and controls

## Security Frameworks

Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy.

## Security Controls

Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. The three more common types of controls are: encryption, authentication, and authorization.
Divided in **Physical controls**, such as gates, guards, locks, and **technical controls** like firewalls, MFA or a antivirus.

### Encryption

The process of converting data from a readable fromat to an encoded format.

### Authentication

The process of verifying who someone or something is. Beside username and password combined, thigns life **MFA** with **biometrics** can be used in order to prove the autenticy of you request.

### Authorization

The concept of granting access to specific resources within a system.

# The CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, And avaliability

## CIA triad

A model that helps inform how organiations consider risk when seeting up systems and security policies.

## Confidentiality

Only authorized users can access specific assets or data.

## Integrity

The data is correct, authentic and reliable.

## Availiability

Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

# NIST Frameworks

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

A voluntary framework that consists of standars, guidelines, and best pratices to manage cybersecurity risk. CSF consists of five important core functions:

- Identify;
- Protect;
- Detect;
- Respond;
- Recover.

#### Identify

The managment of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organization's people and assets.

#### Protect

The strategy used to protect an organization through thei mplementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.

#### Detect

Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections.

#### Respond

Making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, and implement improvements to the security process

#### Recover

The process of returning affected systems back to normal operation.

### NIST S.P. 800-53

A unified framework for protecting the security of information systems within the federal government.

# OWASP Principles and security audits

Project

## OWASP Principles

### Minimize the attack surface area;

Attack surface refers to all the pontetial vulnerabilities a threat actor could exploit.

### Principle of least privilege;

Users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks.

### Defense in depth;

Organizations should have varying security controls that mitigate risks and threats.

### Separation of Duties;

Critical actions should rely on multiple people, each of whom follow the principle of least privilege.

### Keep security simple;

Avoid unnecessarily complicated solutions. Complexity makes security difficult.

### Fix security issues correctly

When security incidents occur, identify the root cause, contain the impact, identify vulnerabilities, and conduct tests to ensure that remediation is successful.

## Security Audit

Review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations.

## Purposes of internal security audit

- Help security teams identify organizational risk;
- Assess controls;
- Correct compliance issues.

## Common elements of a Internal Audit

- Establishing the scope and goals of the audit;
- Conducting a risk assessment of the organization's assets;
- Completing a controls assessment;
- Assessing compliance;
- Communicating results to stakeholders.
