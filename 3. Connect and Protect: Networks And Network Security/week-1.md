# Introduction to networks

## Network

A group of connected devices.

## Local Area Netwrk (LAN)

A network that spans a small area like an office building, a school, or a home.

## Wide Area Network (WAN)

A network that spans a large geographic area like a city, state, or country.

## Hub

A network device that broadcasts information to every device on the network.

## Switch

A device that makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data between them.

## Router

A network device that connects multiple networks together.

## Modem

A device that connects your router to the internet and brings internet access to the **LAN**.

## Virtualization tools

Pieces of software that perform network operations.

## Firewall

A network security device that monitors traffic to or from your network.

## Cloud computing

The rpatice of using remote servers, applications, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of on local physical devices.

## Cloud network

A collection fo servers or computers that stores resources and data in remote data centers that can be accessed via the internet.

# Network communication

## Data Packet

A basic unit of information that travels from one device to another within a network.
It is divided in three parts:

- Header: Where contains the internet protocol address, **IP** and Media Access Control **MAC** adress;

- Body: The message that needs to be delivered.

- Footer: Signals to the receiving device that the packet is finished.

## Bandwidth

The amount of data a device receives every second.

## Speed

The rate at which data packets are received or downloaded.

## Packet sniffing

The pratice of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network.

## TCP/IP

Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol.

## TCP - Trnasmission Control Protocol

An internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data.

## IP - Internet Protocol

A set of standards used for routing and addressing data packets as they travel between devices on a network.

## Port

A software-based location that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices on ad network. Common Port numbers are:

- 25 For email;
- 443 Secure Internet communication (SSH);
- 20 For large file transfers.

## Layers of the TCP/IP Model

- Network Access Layer: Creation of data packets and their transmission across a network;

- Internet layer: Where the IP adress are attached to the data packets to indicate location of the sender and receiver;

- Transport layer: Protocol to control the flow of traffic across a network;

- Application layer: Determine how data packets will interact with receiving devices.
