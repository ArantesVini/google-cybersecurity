# Introduction to network protocols

Network protocols a set of rules used by two or more devices on a network to describe the data order of delivery and the structure of the data.

## Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

An internert communications protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data. Also referred as a handshake.

## User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

Protocol that does not establish a connection between devices before a transmission. Is less reliable than TCP but reach the desrtination quickly.

## Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

A network protocol used to determine the MAC adress of the next router or device on the path.

## HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPs)

A network protocol that provides a secure method of communication between clients and website servers.

## Domain Name System (DNS)

A network protocol that translates internet domain names into IP addresses.

## IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)

_Called I triple E 802.11_
Stands for Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
A set of standards that define communication for wireless LANs.

## WiFi Protected Access (WPA)

A wireless security protocol for devices to connect to the internet.

# System Identification

## Firewall

A network security device that monitors traffic to and from your network. It is divide by hardware, software and cloud-based firewall.

## Port filtering

A firewall function that blocks or allolws certain port numbers to limit unwanted communication.

## Stateful

A class of firewall that keeps track of information passing through it and proactively filters out threats

## Stateless

A class of firewall that operates based on predefined rules and does not keep track of information from data packets

## Next Generation Firewalls (NGFWs)

- Deep packet inspection;
- Intrusion protection;
- Threat intelligence.

## Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

A network security service that changes your public IP address and hides your virtual location so that you can keep your data private when you are using a public network like the internet.

## Encapsulation

A process performed by a VPN service that protects your data by wrapping sensitive data in other data packets.

## Security zone

A segment of a network that protects the intenal network from the internet

## Netowrk segmentation

A security technique that divides the network into segments

## Proxy server

A server that fulfills the requests of a client by forwarding them on to other servers.

## Forward proxy server

Regulates and restricts a person's access to the internet.

## Reverse proxy server

Regulates and restricts the internet's access to an internal server.
