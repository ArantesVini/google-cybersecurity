# The history of Cybersecurity

## Computer virus

Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.
A **WORM** is a type of virus that can spread own without human involvement.

## Malware

Software designed to harm devices or networks.

## Social engineering

A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

## Phising

The use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.

# The eight CISSP security domains

## 1. Security and Risk Managment

Defines security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity and the law.

## 2. Asset Security

Secure digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.

## 3. Security Architecture and Engineering

Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place.

## 4. Communications and NetworkSecurity

Manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications.

## 5. Identify and Access Managment

Keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established polocies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as netowrks and applications.

## 6. Security Assessment and Testing

Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

## 7.Security Operations

Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.

## 8. Software Development Security

Uses secure coding pratices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.

# Types of attack

## Password attack

Attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. examples are:

- Brute furce;
- Rainbow table.

Password attacks fall under the **communication and network security domain**.

## Social engineering attack

Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables, examples:

- Phishing;
- Smishing;
- Vishing;
- Spear phishing;
- Whaling;
- Social media phishing;
- Business Email Compromise (BEC);
- Watering hole attack;
- USB (Universal Serial Bus) baiting;
- Physical social engineering.

Social engineering attacks are related to the **security and risk management domain**.

## Physical attack

Is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed, like:

- Malicious USB cable;
- Malicious flash drive;
- Card cloning and skimming.

Physical attacks fall under the **asset security domain**.

## Adversarial artificial intelligence

Is a technique that manipulates AI / ML to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial AI falls under both **communication and network security** and **the identity and access management domains**.

## Supply-chain attack

A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the **security and risk management**, **security architecture and engineering**, and **security operations domains**.

## Cryptographic attack

A cryptographic attack affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are:

- Birthday;
- Collision;
- Downgrade.

Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain.

# Understand attackers

A threat actor is any person or group who presents a security risk.

## Threat actor types

### Advanced persistent threats (APTs)

Have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authrization, usually the targets of APTs are **large corporations** or **government entities**. Their intetions can include: **Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources** and **Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents**.

### Insider threats

Abuse their authorized acces to obtain data that may harm an organizations, their intentions can inclue: **sabotage**, **corruption**, **espionage**, or **unauthorized data access or leaks**.

### Hacktivists

Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include: **Demonstrations**, **Propaganda**, **Social change campaigns**, **Fame**.
